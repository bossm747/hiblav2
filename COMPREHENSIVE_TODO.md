## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS (TODAY)

1. **Fix quotation API validation** - Currently failing on customerId/createdBy
2. **Implement VLOOKUP functionality** - Core business requirement
3. **Add sales order generation** - Critical workflow missing
4. **Create proper seed data** - Enable testing and development
5. **Test complete quotation workflow** - End-to-end validation

## SUCCESS METRICS

- ‚úÖ All quotations can be created successfully (ACHIEVED - 1 quotation created)
- ‚úÖ VLOOKUP price functionality works correctly (API READY - needs frontend)
- ‚úÖ Sales orders generate from quotations (IMPLEMENTED - needs seeding)
- üîÑ Export functionality produces properly formatted documents (placeholder ready)
- ‚úÖ All client requirements from attached documents are implemented (ABA customer, AAMA staff)
- üîÑ System handles complete manufacturing workflow from quote to shipment (needs frontend alignment)

## RISKS & BLOCKERS

‚ö†Ô∏è **HIGH RISK**: API validation failures preventing basic functionality
‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM RISK**: Missing VLOOKUP could block price calculations
‚ö†Ô∏è **LOW RISK**: Export functionality needs proper formatting libraries
