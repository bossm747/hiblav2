## Manufacturing Workflow

1. **Quotation Creation**: Customer inquiries converted to formal quotations
2. **Quote Approval**: Customer reviews and accepts quotations
3. **Sales Order Generation**: Approved quotations become confirmed sales orders
4. **Job Order Creation**: Sales orders trigger production job orders
5. **Production Tracking**: Items manufactured and marked as ready
6. **Shipment Management**: Ready items shipped to customers
7. **Completion & Invoicing**: Orders completed with payment tracking
- **Forms**: Validated forms using React Hook Form + Zod
- **Data Display**: Cards, tables, and lists with loading states
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties for consistent theming

## Data Flow

### Client-Server Communication
1. Frontend makes API requests using TanStack Query
2. Requests are handled by Express.js routes in `server/routes.ts`
3. Data operations are abstracted through storage layer (`server/storage.ts`)
4. Response data is cached and managed by TanStack Query on the client

### Form Handling
1. Forms use shared Zod schemas for validation
2. React Hook Form manages form state and client-side validation
3. Form submission triggers API calls via TanStack Query mutations
4. Success/error states are handled with toast notifications

### State Management
- **Server State**: Managed by TanStack Query with automatic caching and refetching
- **Client State**: Local component state using React hooks
- **Form State**: React Hook Form for form-specific state management

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with ShadCN customizations
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Forms**: React Hook Form, Hookform resolvers for Zod integration
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query for server state management
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Date Handling**: date-fns for date manipulation
- **Icons**: Lucide React icon library

### Backend Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL, Drizzle ORM
- **Validation**: Zod for request validation
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution, esbuild for production builds

### Development Tools
- **Build System**: Vite with React plugin and error overlay
- **TypeScript**: Strict configuration with path mapping
- **Code Quality**: ESLint and Prettier (implied by project structure)

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend**: Vite builds the React app to `dist/public/`
2. **Backend**: esbuild bundles the Express server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle handles schema migrations and database provisioning

### Environment Configuration
- Database connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- Development vs production modes with appropriate middleware
- Vite development server integration for seamless full-stack development

### Production Deployment
- Single deployment unit with both frontend and backend
- Static assets served by Express in production
- Database migrations handled by Drizzle CLI commands
- Support for platforms like Replit with specialized configuration

The architecture prioritizes developer experience with hot reloading, type safety across the full stack, and a component-based UI system that scales well for business applications.
