# Complete Quotation System Implementation

## Phase 1: Core API Fix âœ… NEARLY COMPLETE

- [x] Added getLatestQuotation method to interface and implementation  
- [x] Fixed customer and staff assignment logic
- [x] Fixed customer password constraint issue (added required password field)

- [ ] Test quotation creation success - FINAL TEST
- [x] Implement comprehensive error handling with detailed logging

## Phase 2: VLOOKUP Price System (CLIENT CRITICAL)
```javascript
// Implementation Plan:
1. Add price lookup API endpoint: /api/products/price-lookup
2. Frontend: handleProductSelect with automatic price population
3. Backend: Switch case for priceListA, B, C, D lookup
4. Validation: Ensure price exists for selected price list
```

## Phase 3: Sales Order Generation (CLIENT CRITICAL)  
```javascript
// Implementation Plan:
1. Add POST /api/quotations/:id/generate-sales-order endpoint
2. Copy quotation data to sales order format
3. Set proper YYYY.MM.### numbering
4. Update quotation status to "converted"
5. Frontend button to trigger generation
```
