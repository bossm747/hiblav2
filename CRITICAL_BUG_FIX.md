# Critical Bug Fix: Customer Creation Password Constraint

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database Schema Issue**: `customers` table has NOT NULL constraint on `password` field
2. **API Call Failure**: Customer creation fails during quotation creation process
3. **Cascade Effect**: Quotation creation fails because customer creation fails
4. **Validation Error**: customerId and createdBy remain undefined due to failed customer creation

## Solutions Implemented
1. âœ… Added password field to customer creation in routes.ts
2. âœ… Added fallback password handling in storage.ts  
3. âœ… Added debug logging for customer creation
4. ðŸ”„ Testing customer creation with required fields

## Next Steps
1. Verify customer creation works
2. Test complete quotation creation workflow
3. Implement VLOOKUP price functionality
4. Add sales order generation
5. Complete client requirements

## Database Schema Fix Required
- Consider making password field nullable for manufacturing customers
- Or implement proper customer authentication system
- Current workaround: Use temporary password for manufacturing-only customers
