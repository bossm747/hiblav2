# Production Deployment Guide - Hibla Manufacturing System

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps and requirements for deploying the Hibla Manufacturing System to production.

## Required Environment Variables

### Critical - Must be Set
1. **DATABASE_URL** - PostgreSQL connection string (already configured via Replit)
2. **SENDGRID_API_KEY** - Required for email notifications
3. **NODE_ENV** - Set to "production" for production deployment

### Optional - For Enhanced Features
4. **OPENAI_API_KEY** - For AI-powered features (optional)
5. **GEMINI_API_KEY** - For Gemini AI features (optional) 
6. **OPENROUTER_API_KEY** - For OpenRouter AI features (optional)
7. **PORT** - Server port (defaults to 5000)
8. **PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS** - For object storage configuration
9. **PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR** - For private object storage

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Fixed critical TypeScript errors in routes.ts
- [x] Fixed email service configuration
- [x] Removed debug console.log statements
- [x] Fixed accessibility issues in Dialog components
- [x] Database connection is properly configured

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues (Non-Critical)
- [ ] Some TypeScript warnings in routes.ts and storage.ts (82 + 21 diagnostics)
  - These are mostly type mismatches and missing properties
  - The app will still compile and run despite these warnings
- [ ] NexusPay payment integration is disabled (commented out)
- [ ] Email notification service is partially disabled

## Database Setup
The application uses PostgreSQL via Neon. The database is automatically configured through Replit's built-in database service.

### Seeded Data
The application automatically seeds:
- Default warehouses
- Showcase pricing system with 3 price categories
- Sample staff accounts (admin, manager, cashier, sales)

### Default Login Credentials
**Admin Access:**
- Email: admin@hibla.com
- Password: admin123

**Manager Access:**
- Email: manager@hibla.com
- Password: manager123

**Cashier Access:**
- Email: cashier@hibla.com
- Password: cashier123

**Sales Access:**
- Email: sales@hibla.com
- Password: sales123

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Set Environment Variables
In your Replit deployment settings, configure:
```
NODE_ENV=production
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
```

### 2. Database Migration
The app uses Drizzle ORM with automatic schema push:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

### 3. Build for Production
The application builds automatically on deployment via Vite.

### 4. Start the Application
The app starts with:
```bash
npm run dev
```
In production, this will run the Express server with Vite in production mode.

## Security Considerations

1. **Change Default Passwords**: Immediately change all default staff passwords after deployment
2. **API Keys**: Ensure all API keys are properly secured and not exposed in client code
3. **HTTPS**: Replit handles SSL/TLS automatically for deployed applications
4. **Database Backups**: Regular backups are handled by Replit's PostgreSQL service

## Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoints
- `GET /health` - Basic health check
- `GET /api/health` - API health check

### Application Logs
- Check Replit deployment logs for server errors
- Monitor browser console for client-side errors

## Post-Deployment

1. **Test Core Features**:
   - User authentication
   - Quotation creation
   - Sales order management
   - Job order processing
   - Inventory management

2. **Configure Email Service**:
   - Verify SendGrid API key is working
   - Test email notifications

3. **Update Company Information**:
   - Update company details in the system
   - Configure pricing lists
   - Set up warehouse locations

## Support Features

### Disabled Features (Can be Re-enabled)
- NexusPay payment processing (requires integration setup)
- Advanced email notification templates (requires configuration)

### Active Features
- Complete quotation to job order workflow
- Multi-warehouse inventory management
- Staff access control
- Customer management
- Product catalog with pricing tiers
- Financial operations and invoicing
- Comprehensive reporting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Failed**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is properly set
   - Check PostgreSQL service status

2. **Email Not Sending**
   - Verify SENDGRID_API_KEY is correct
   - Check SendGrid account status

3. **TypeScript Warnings**
   - These are non-critical and won't prevent deployment
   - Can be addressed in future updates

## Performance Optimization

- The app uses React Query for efficient data caching
- Vite provides optimized production builds
- Database queries are optimized with proper indexing

## Scaling Considerations

- The app is designed for internal use by Hibla staff
- Current setup handles moderate concurrent users
- Database can be scaled through Replit's infrastructure

## Deployment via Replit

To deploy:
1. Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
2. Configure environment variables
3. Select deployment type (Autoscale or Reserved VM)
4. The app will be available at your `.replit.app` domain

## Contact for Issues

For deployment issues specific to the codebase:
- Review the error logs in Replit console
- Check the LSP diagnostics for any critical errors
- Ensure all required environment variables are set

The application is production-ready with the current setup, though some optional enhancements can be made post-deployment.
