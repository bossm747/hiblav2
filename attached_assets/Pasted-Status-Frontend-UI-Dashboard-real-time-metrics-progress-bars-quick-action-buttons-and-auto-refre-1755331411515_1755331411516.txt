Status
Frontend UI
Dashboard: real‑time metrics, progress bars, quick‑action buttons, and auto‑refresh every 30 seconds.
QuotationDetailModal: full header, status badge, action dropdown (edit, duplicate, delete, convert to sales order, approve/reject, export PDF, send email, print), detailed customer/shipping/financial sections, and item table.
JobOrderDetailModal: status badge with color‑coded icons, action dropdown (edit, duplicate, delete, start/complete production, export PDF, send email, print), production progress overview (overall % + summary cards), and item table with progress calculations.
Consistent UI: All modals use the same DropdownMenu pattern, ensuring a uniform user experience.
Pages: Dedicated dashboards for administration, assets, categories, inventory, production, financial operations, reports, sales, and login.
Responsive: Mobile‑friendly components, theme toggle, and role‑based sidebars.
Backend API
Routes: All CRUD endpoints for authentication, customers, staff, products, quotations, sales orders, job orders, invoices, payments, warehouses, inventory, dashboard analytics, file uploads, and health checks are present and functional.
Services: Document automation (pdf-generator.ts), invoice generation, production service, inventory‑transfer service (present but not yet used for warehouse transfers), AI services, and email service.
Entry Point: server/index.ts correctly detects deployment vs. development, builds production bundle when needed, and registers routes.
Database: Drizzle ORM schema covers all entities (customers, staff, products, quotations, sales orders, job orders, invoices, payments, warehouses, inventory transactions, etc.).
File Upload: Multer handling with static /uploads serving.
Gaps & Next Steps
Warehouse Transfer Tracking: No routes, services, or UI components for real‑time transfer tracking, timestamps, or PDF integration. This is the only major missing feature.
Delete Actions: The Delete menu items in modals are present but lack handler implementation; they can be wired to the existing DELETE endpoints.
Minor TypeScript warnings: Non‑critical warnings exist but do not affect functionality.
Recommendation
Implement Warehouse Transfer Tracking:
Add API endpoints (/api/warehouse-transfers), service (inventory-transfer-service.ts), and UI components (modal, table, progress bar).
Integrate with PDF generator for transfer reports.
Add UI actions (create, edit, delete, export PDF, email) similar to existing modals.
Wire Delete Handlers: Connect the Delete menu items to backend DELETE endpoints for each entity.
Testing & Deployment: Run npm run build and npm start in production mode, verify health endpoints, and perform end‑to‑end tests for the new warehouse‑transfer feature.
