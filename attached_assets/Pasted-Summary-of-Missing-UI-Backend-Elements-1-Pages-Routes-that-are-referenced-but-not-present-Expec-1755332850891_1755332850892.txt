4. Functionalities still missing
Warehouse Transfer Tracking
API endpoints: GET /api/warehouse-transfers, POST, PATCH, DELETE.
Service: warehouse-transfer-service.ts (create, update, fetch, timestamp on shipment).
UI: WarehouseTransferModal, table view, timestamp column, status badge.
PDF/Excel export for transfer reports.
Real‑time update (WebSocket/SSE) to show when a transfer occurs.
Delete Handlers for quotations and job orders.
Export PDF / Email implementations for both quotations and job orders.
Duplicate / Convert to Sales Order logic (API endpoint to create a sales order from a quotation, and to duplicate a record).
Report Export (Excel & PDF) for the Ready Items Summary.
Vendor / Rider Onboarding (if needed later) – not required for shipment tracking but mentioned in earlier suggestions.
Admin Tools: notification logs, template management, audit logs, manual notification send.
Authentication & Role‑Based UI: Ensure role‑based navigation (admin vs. staff) is enforced; currently only generic routes exist.
Testing & CI: No unit/E2E tests, no CI pipeline.
Documentation: OpenAPI spec, developer README, user guides for new features.
5. What to do next
Create missing pages (quotations, sales orders, job orders, inventory, reports) using the existing UI patterns (cards, tables, dropdowns).
Implement missing API endpoints for delete, duplicate, convert to sales order, and warehouse transfer.
Add missing components (FileBrowserModal, OpenFileBrowserButton, ActionDropdown, StatusBadge, HeaderInfoCard, ReportFilter, WarehouseTransferModal).
Wire up Delete, Export PDF, Send Email, Duplicate, and Transfer actions to the backend services.
Add a simple timestamp field (shippedAt) to job_order_items and update it via a ship endpoint; display it in the Job Order modal.
Add a simple Warehouse Transfer page with a table, create/edit modal, and export options.
Add unit/E2E tests and CI pipeline to ensure future changes do not break existing functionality.
