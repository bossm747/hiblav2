I understand - the system is shifting from a customer-facing platform to a purely internal company system. Let me brainstorm the best process flow for an internal manufacturing management system.

Proposed Internal System Process Flow
Core User Roles (Internal Staff Only)
Sales Team - Manages customer relationships, creates quotations, converts to sales orders
Production Team - Handles job orders, manages production workflow
Inventory Team - Manages stock levels, transfers between warehouses
Shipping Team - Handles order fulfillment and delivery
Management - Oversees operations, views reports, makes strategic decisions
Admin - System configuration, user management, pricing
Streamlined Internal Workflow
1. Sales Process (Internal)

Sales staff receive customer inquiries via email/phone
Create quotations in the system with customer details
Send quotation PDFs to customers via email
Track quotation status internally
Convert approved quotations to sales orders
2. Order Processing

Sales orders automatically generate job orders
Production team receives job order notifications
No customer confirmation needed - all handled internally
Payment tracking managed through accounting notes
3. Production Management

Production team updates job order status
Real-time inventory deduction
Quality control checkpoints
Internal notes and communications
4. Fulfillment

Shipping team prepares orders
Generate shipping labels and invoices
Update delivery status
Internal tracking only
Components to Remove
Customer portal pages
Customer authentication/login
Payment proof uploads
Customer order tracking
Customer-facing notifications
Public-facing APIs
Components to Enhance
Staff role-based permissions
Internal communication tools
Production workflow automation
Inventory management across warehouses
Internal reporting and analytics
Staff productivity tracking
Benefits of Internal-Only System
Simplified architecture
Faster operations
Better security (no external access)
Streamlined workflows
Focus on operational efficiency
Reduced complexity
Would you like me to proceed with removing the customer-facing components and implementing this internal-only workflow? I can:

Remove all customer portal related code
Enhance staff authentication and roles
Streamline the internal workflow
Update the documentation to reflect the new architecture
What aspects of this internal system are most important to prioritize?
