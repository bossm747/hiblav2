# Management Pages Implementation TODO

## ANALYSIS: Schema vs Client Requirements Gaps

### ðŸš¨ CRITICAL SCHEMA ISSUES TO FIX:
1. **Warehouses table missing role-based access** - Client specifies Manager/Viewer permissions
2. **InventoryItems table missing** - Client needs inventory movement tracking with reference numbers
3. **Shipments table missing** - Client needs shipment tracking from Reserved warehouse
4. **Missing proper inventory movement fields** - Client specifies specific movement types
5. **Job Order calculations not automated** - Client needs auto-calculated Ready, To Produce fields

### ðŸ”§ SCHEMA FIXES NEEDED (Before Implementation):

1. **Add warehouse permissions to warehouses table:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE warehouses ADD COLUMN managers text[] DEFAULT '{}';
ALTER TABLE warehouses ADD COLUMN viewers text[] DEFAULT '{}';
```

2. **Create inventory_items table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE inventory_items (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  reference_number TEXT NOT NULL,
  product_id VARCHAR REFERENCES products(id),
  warehouse_id VARCHAR REFERENCES warehouses(id),
  movement_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- deposit, withdrawal
  quantity DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  sales_order_id VARCHAR REFERENCES sales_orders(id),
  packing_list_number TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

3. **Create shipments table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE shipments (
  id VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  shipment_number TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  sales_order_id VARCHAR REFERENCES sales_orders(id),
  warehouse_id VARCHAR REFERENCES warehouses(id),
  shipping_method TEXT NOT NULL,
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'pending',
  tracking_number TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
1. Fix remaining query client issues (27 errors)
2. Apply schema fixes with migrations
3. Implement Products Management (highest business value)
4. Implement Warehouse Management (role-based access)
5. Redesign Inventory Tracking (client workflow alignment)
6. Complete remaining pages in priority order

## SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- 100% test success rate with real data
- Zero mock/hardcoded data
- Client workflow compliance
- Production-ready implementation
- Type-safe TypeScript throughout
